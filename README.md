## 👨‍💻 About Me

At 15, I jumped into programming and software development, building my first tech community with 200+ members and leading both technical and organizational ventures. By 16, I started monetizing my programming skills through freelance and community projects. At 19, my journey took me deep into C programming for microcontroller-to-PC communications at Vaga Beta, combining hardware and software in robust tech solutions.

Today, I blend my **academic insight** as a student at the University of Niš, Faculty of Electronic Engineering, with hands-on industry know-how, always eager to push **integrated technology solutions** that merge electronics, software, and automation.
